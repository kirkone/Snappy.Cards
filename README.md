Snappy Cards is for sharing your contact information with others.
This card works with data **only** beeing stored in the URL.
To make sharing easier a QR code is also generated.

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages under [snappy.cards/#...](https://snappy.cards/#name=Max%20Mustermann&phone=%2b49%20123%204567890&mail=no@mail.de&web=blog.undefined.de&sub=Mustermann&avatar=random&background=random) and can be modified by using several [parameters](#parameters).

> **Important**:
> The parameters coming after the `#` will never be sent to the server.
> So **everything** stays on **your** client!
> More details about this can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment).
